== TLang
-- A Tree Processing Language

The core idea of the T language is to create a language that lends itself well to
creating, manipulating and transforming trees.


Hi-level goals:

- **Incremental**: T primitives should be support incremental algorithm
  that can transform *deltas* into *data transformations*.

- **Typed**:


# EOF - vim: ts=2 sw=2 et syn=texto
