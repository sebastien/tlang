== TLang Interpreter

TLang has multiple interpreters that will produce different values or effects
given the same AST:

- Literal: produces literal values from a subset of the AST. For instance
  `(1 2 3)` would produce a list, `( (a: 0) (b: 2) (c: 3) )` would produce
  a map.

- Tree: interprets the AST as the description of a tree. For instance
  `(html (@xml:lang "en"))` would produce an HTML node.

- Process: that is what a regular interpeter would do, it turns the
  expressions into values and effects.

The invocation protocol (application) can then make use of different
interpretations:

- `raw` passes the AST as-is
- `data` evaluates the AST node as a data structure
- `process` turns the AST node into a generator of values and effects

Ex: `(lambda ARGS CODEâ€¦)` evaluates `ARGS` as `raw` and extracts the names
of the arguments, and then `CODE` is only evaluated when the `lambda` is
used in an invocation. It returns a value that needs N arguments to work.


Here's an interesting perspective on closure: what if we consider a closure
as a stream where:

```
(lambda (A B) (+ A B))
```

generates a process that is like the following (note how the instructions
are unstructured, that's important).

```
;; We declare + as a primitive for this process (ie. it's already available
;; and bound)
(primitive +)
;; We define slots for our arguments A,B and our result R
(slots A B R)
;; We receive values A and B from the environment (they're dynamic)
(receive! :in A)
(receive! :in B)
;; We open a subchannel I using the '+' symbol, which spawns a new
;; subprocess with + and opens a communication channel I.
(open I +)
;; We send A and B to I
(emit! I A)
(emit! I B)
;; Because + only takes 2 arguments, the process now executes and we're
;; ready to receive the value.
(receive! I R)
(emit! :out R)
```

This would make it relatively easy to suspend a lambda, because in that case
we just need to keep the slots and the instruction pointer.

It also opens the door to streaming composition. Let's look at the following
pipeline, which represents a classic data pipeline for preparing paginated
filtered results.

```
(map ITEMS normalize-item) | (filter criteria) | (sort key) | (take 10)
;; A                         B                    C            D
```

We'll need to iterate on ITEMS in A, then again in B, then again in C on
the filtered set then again on at most 10 elements.

While C needs a full iteration (it's a sort), we could certainly collapse the
map and the filter. We could define a map filter operation, but maybe the
interpreter would be able to automatically combine both.

But if the iteration and the pipe are lazy, ie. it happens one element at
a time, then the step A will fee B, wich will feed C and D. If we remove
the sort, we should only iterate on 10 elements.

That's already possible if we're using itertors, so the idea is to have
the same notion but reified at the interpreter level (maybe using the iter
primitive?).
