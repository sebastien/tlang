== Projections

The idea of projections is that given a series of transformations T0→…→TN, it is
possible to compute the transformation T0→TN in one shot (or as close to one shot
as possible).


Reversible projections
======================

Some transformations might be irreversible (ie, it's impossible to get T0 from T1),
while some might be. In case a transformation is irreversible, there should be some
extra data saved so that we can compute T0 from T1 and this extra data.
