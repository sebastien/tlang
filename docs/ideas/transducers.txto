Link references to their definitions
------------------------------------

The following effector will update the link between reference nodes
and their definition.

```tlang

(schema
	(ref    (@ (name :String) (symbol (? symbol)) ))
	(symbol (@ (name :string) (refs   (* ref))    )))


;; We select all the references. `$0` and `$REF` will reference the `ref`
;; node, while `$NAME` and `$1` will reference `{@name}`.
(on #change {REF:ref}/{NAME:@name}

	;; We remove the node from the referenced symbol
	(do #remove REF/@symbol/@refs  REF)

    (when @name
		;; We resolve the symbol by looking back in the traversal
		;; for a definition with the given name. We save the
		;; result as SYMBOL
		(when {SYMBOL:.<<def*/{@name:ATTR}[(eq? ATTR NAME)] | head}
			;; We set the resolved symbol as the attribute value
			(do #set $REF/@symbol  SYMBOL)
			;; We remove the symbol
			(do #add   $SYMBOL/@refs REF))))

```

Here the *schema* is used to statically check that the operations
make sense (ie. the attribute/node is defined, and its type is valid).

Then the *transducer* is used to express a transformation. What we can
deduce from the above is the following:

- When the `ref` node has a `@name`, we'll need to search the up the
  walk path for a matching `symbol`. A conclusion is that during a walk,
  `symbol` nodes should be indexed by `@name`.

- Attributes are used to maintain meta-information and effectively create
  a graph-like structure.

We can now express what happens when a symbol changes:

```tlang
(on #change {SYMBOL:symbol}/@name 
    (do #clear ./@refs/ref/@symbol .))
```

However, here we can see that that we're changing the `@symbol`, and the
compiler should tell us that we need to support that change as well.


```tlang
(on #change {REF:ref}/@symbol 
    (do #remove  PREVIOUS/@refs, REF ))
``` 

Now the compiler shoud know that `symbol/@ref` is changed, so we need to
handle it as well:

```tlang
(on #remove {SYMBOL:symbol}/@refs
	(do #unset REMOVED/@symbol  SYMBOL))

(on #added {SYMBOL:symbol}/@refs
	(do #set  ADDED/@symbol  SYMBOL))
```

We have introduced a mutually-recursive dependency, which is a potentially
problematic. Also, in general it might be quite tricky to ensure that there
is not going to be an issue.

```
symbol/@ref → ref/@symbol
ref/@symbol → symbol/@ref
```

So one idea would be to setup capabilities/rights so that we know who is
responsible for maintaining the consistency of a set of dependent attributes.
In our case, we have `symbol/@ref` and `ref/@symbol` that are mutually
dependent.

```
(on #change {SYMBOL:symbol}/@ref
	(pre ref/@symbol[@=SYMBOL]))
```

Synthetic attributes
--------------------

It might be better to express attributes as synthetic and do that declaratively,
as opposed to the event-driven way that implicitely denotes the actual constraints
of the data.

Compiler
======== 

The compiler should:

1) Make sure that any referenced node/attribute is defined in the schema, which
   ensures there's no type and the data is fully captured.

2) Make sure that any mutating operation conforms with the constraints and
   should be determined statically.

3) Created indexes and lookup structures based on expensive selectors like
   `>>`, `<<`, `\\` or `//`.
