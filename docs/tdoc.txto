== Tree documentation format

The tree documentation format (or _tdoc_ for short) is a way to easily write
tree-structured data using a regular text editor. This format makes it possible
to embed other languages within the document (markdown, javascript, CSV, etc) and
also embed TDoc within another language.

Embedded languages are either left unparsed, as raw strings, or parsed as a tree structure,
when a rich parser is available.

As such, it provides an easy way to wrap existing code in a tree structure, 
and create hybrid documents that contain more than one language.

The tree block syntax is a tab-indented format, where the nesting of content
is primarily determined by the indentation level. This is not a hard rule, however,
as the `tdoc` command also supports space-indentation.

Syntax
======

Nodes
-----

Nodes have a _name_ (which can optionally be prefixed by a _namespace_),and
optional _attributes_. 

The node is then followed by an optional first line of content, separated by `:
` (note the space after the colon). The rest of the content is then within one
level of indentation relative to the node.

```
NODE: TEXT
	CONTENT
```

Here is an example of an HTML document encoded in tdoc:

```
html
	body
		h1: Hello, world
		p: Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet
```

In case where your content might be accidentaly intepreted as a node declaration, you can 
prefix it directly with `:` (no extra space needed), like so:

```
p
	:hello
	:world
``` 

Note that there is no way to encode a node inline, ie. you can only
have one node per line. That means that the following HTML code:

```html
<p>Hello, <em>World</em>!<p>
```

can only be written

```
p: Hello, 
	em: World
	!
```

Attributes
----------

Attributes in a node can be declared with the `ATTR=VALUE` syntax, like so:

```
body style=background-color:#E0E0E0;padding:40px; lang=en
```

In case the attribute value contains a space, you can quote the string using
double `"` or single `'` quotes, escaping inner quotes with a backslash `\\` 
like in pretty much all languages.

```tdoc
button title='Don\'t click me!'
```

In case you want to have an attribute with no value, suffix its name with `=`

```tdoc
button disabled=: Save
```

Alternatively, attributes can be defined as content using the `@ATTR VALUE`
notation:

```
rect
	@width 300
	@height 200
```

When used this way, there can be only one attribute per line, and you don't 
have to use quotes (but you can if you want to).

Namespaces
----------

XML and XSLT make extensive use of namespace to combine documents, and namespaces
should be available both in nodes and attributes. In TDoc, namespaces prefix
node or attribute names and are followed by `:`, with no space so as not to clash
with the `: ` content separator (`NAMESPACE:NAME`):

```
html xmlns:svg=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg
	body
		svg:svg width=200 height=200
			svg:circle
				@svg:cx 100
				@svg:cy 100
				@svg:r 100
```

Node names
----------

There is a shorthand syntax for the `node id=myNodeName"` in the form:

```
NODE#NAME
```

Parsers
-------

Node content can be specified as being expressed in a different syntax, for
instance if you're embedding a block of markdown text, or some C or Python
code. In that case, you can suffix the node declaration with a `|` followed by
your parser's name:

````
p|markdown
	Hello, *world*!
code|c
	#include <stdio.h>
	void main void {
		printf("Hello, world!\n");
	}
```

By using parsers, you delegate the parsing of the content (any contiguous
block with at least one more indentation level) to the parser with the given 
name.

This means that any line that the set of contiguous line with an indentation 
level greater than the node with the custom parser is going to be fed 
as-is to the custom parser.

If the parser is registered within tdoc's interpreter, then the content
might be parsed and expanded to a tree, otherwise it's going to be integrated
as a raw string, after the initial indentation is removed.

Note that parsers should be defined just after the node name, so you can
still write attributes after


```tdoc
pre|javascript id=myscript
	function(){
		…
	}
```

Comments
--------

Comments are lines that start with a hash `#`, and might be indented at any
level. If you have a node content that starts with a hash, you can use the same
content escaping trick as if you content could be interpreted as node:

```tdoc
p
	:# This is not a comment.
```

However, when the `#` is contained within a node that has a custom parser, 
then the line will be considered content if it has an indentation greater
than the indentation of the node with the custom parser.

White space
-----------

It's good to note that whitespace is entirely preserved by tdoc, once 
the indentation, separators and end of line have been removed. This means 
that the following TDoc document:

```tdoc
p
	lorem ipsum
	dolor sit amet
```

would, converted to a Lisp-like structure yield:

```scheme
(p "lorem ipsum" "dolor sit amet")
```

Meaning that you'll need to join the two lines with a space or newline if
you want to have `lorem ipsum dolor sit amet`  instead of `lorem ipsumdolor sit amet`.

There are some specific cases to think about, though, especially when it comes
to empty lines:

    --INDENT--
    If a line has only tabs and spaces, it is not empty: the spaces count as 
    content (which is what is expected, because TDoc preserves whitespace)

```tdoc
p
	This is not an empty line
	# The line below is empty ie. (\t\n) ― it contains only indentation
	
	# The line below is NOT empty (\t \n) ― it contains a space right after the indent
	 
```

If a line has only indentation, but has an indentation greater than a parent
block then it is not an empty line, and any character after the parent's indent
level + 1 is taken as content:

```tdoc
code
	def foo():
		print("spam")
```

will yield

```sexpr
(p "def foo():" "\tprint(\"spam\")")
```

If a line has only indentation, which is lower or equal to the current parent's,
then it is taken as an empty line and skipped, unless it is within a block 
with a custom parser.

Empty lines are usually ignored except in the case where a parser is used
(like in `section|markdown`), in which case an empty line is interpreted
as an `\n` in the reconstructed code.

```tdoc
code|js
	function hello(){
		console.log("Hello,world")
	}

	hello();
```

will result in 

```sexpr
(code "function hello(){\n\tconsole.log(\"Hello,world\")\n}\nhello();\n")
```

Another special treatment is that in that case the indentation of the line is 
irrelevant if lesser or equal than the current block indentation.

Embedded mode
=============

TDoc can also be used as embedded in another language. For instance,
if you're writing a program and would like to 
add structured data, add embedded documentation or write your code
in a litterate programming approach:

```c
/**
title: An example of embedded TDoc
p|markdown
	You'd invoke this using
	```shell
	tdoc -Iembed --embed-start='/**' --embed=end='*/'
	```
*/
#include <stdio.h>
void main(void){
	print("Hello, world!\n");
}
```

processing with `tdoc -e` would yield the following tree:

```
```

or if you're using single-line comments,

```shell
## title: An example of embedded TDoc
## p|markdown
## 	You'd invoke this using
## 	```shell
## 	tdoc -Iembed='## '
## 	```
echo "Hello, world"
```

Specifying indentation
----------------------

You can specify directives by using nodes and attributes in the `tdoc` namespace.
For instance, you can have a top-level attribute defining how the parsing
should happen:

```tdoc
@tdoc:indent spaces=2
```

```
@tdoc:indent tabs
```

will tell TDoc to consider two spaces as the default indentation. You could do
`@tdoc:indent tabs` or `@tdoc:indent spaces=4`, etc.

Specifying content nesting
--------------------------

Code will be wrapped in `code` nodes and inserted as a child of the current
parent. In the following example, we want to make sure the function's code
is not nested under the `param` node:

```python
## section#functions title="Function definition"
##   function#hello_world
##     param name=message type=str default="Hello, world"
##        The message to be displayed
##     :
def hello_world(message='Hello, world!'):
    """Prints 'Hello, world!'."""
    print (message)
```

To do so, we add an empty line, denoted by `:`, that will set the
`function` node as the current parent.

- [HAML], [PAML], [Pug]: these languages are all meant to writing (HT|X)ML
  more easily. TDoc's design is actually derived from years of writing XML
  and XSLT using PAML, and tries to keep the good parts while simplyfing
  the syntax further.

- [TreeNotation]: while conceptually closer, tree notation is hard to
  understand because it lacks a clear definition.
