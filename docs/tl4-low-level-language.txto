== TLang Low Level Language (TL4)

TLang's low-level language is both a textual and binary format for defining
TLang programs that operate on trees. TLang's high-level languages (query, 
schema, tree representation, etc) are meant to describe applications
and behaviours, while TLang's low-level language is meant to drive the
engine, which builds, queries and modifies trees.

The instruction set defined in TL4 is all that is required to run TLang
programs. The language is designed based on the following principles:

- Assembly-like: TL4 should feel like a specialized assembly for operating
  on trees.

- Cursor: like a line plotter or a 3D printer, TL4 is all about piloting
  a virtual cursor that moves over the tree and queries/builds/removes parts
  of it.

- Readable: TL4 programs should be writable by hand and should be readable
  when machine-generated.

In particular, we want TL4 to fit the following use cases:

- Compilers: make it easier to experiment with queries and transform 
  optimization startegies, and make the compiled code easier to debug.

- Protocol for remote tree interaction: a user interface might interact with
  a tree data using TL4 as an way to operate on the tree.

- A way to send patches on tree data: â€¦
