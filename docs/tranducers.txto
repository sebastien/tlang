== Transducers

The [transducer language] defines how to transform a set of changes made
to a tree into a set of changes to be made on another three. Transducers
support incremental transformation of trees and can be efficiently
combined and composed.

[Tree Transducers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_transducer) is 
a family of "abstract machines" that transform trees, and you can learn more
about it in the [TATA paper](https://gforge.inria.fr/frs/download.php/10994/tata.pdf).
