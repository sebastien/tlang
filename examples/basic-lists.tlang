;; As TLang is a Lisp-like, you'll need to quote (`'`) any list so that
;; it is not interpreted as an invocation.

;; A list
'(1 2 3 4)

;; A list with items of different types
'(1 "one" :Two #three)

;; A list with one element
'(1)

;; An empty list
()

;; You can also use quote directly
;; FIXME: Not working yet
;; (quote 1 2 3 4)
;; (quote (1 2 3 4))
