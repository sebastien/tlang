(primitive match out!)

;; It should probably be something more high level like
;; (switch N (0 (out! "0")) (1 (out! "2")) (N (out!)))
;; Or we could do something different like
;; (lazy (lazy AC AE) (lazy BC BE) …) | first (→ (A) (# A 0)) | rest
;; Which means that we create a lazy iterator of iterato with all the 
;; branches (COND EXPR…) 


(match 0
	(1     (out! "1"))
	(0     (out! "0")))
